# Introduction

This project allows you to load third-party mods into the game and helps you by supplying useful utilities provided by the [core](https://github.com/CoroModLoader/core).

# Installation

* Locate your game directory
  > e.g. `C:/GOG Games/Coromon/`

* Download the zip file from the latest [Release](https://github.com/CoroModLoader/loader/releases) and unpack all files into the game directory
  * Your Game Folder should now roughly look like this
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Some files have been omitted
    ```
    ðŸ“‚ C:/GOG Games/Coromon
    â”œâ”€â”€ coromon.exe
    â”œâ”€â”€ CoronaLabs.Corona.Native.dll
    â”œâ”€â”€ corona-plugins
    â”œâ”€â”€ iphlpapi.dll                  <-- This file should be new
    â”œâ”€â”€ libeay32.dll
    â”œâ”€â”€ lua.dll
    â”œâ”€â”€ ...
    ```

* When starting the game a `coromodloader.log` should appear in the game directory
  * > [!WARNING]  
    > If this does not happen you probably did something wrong.

* Done!

# Un-Installation
